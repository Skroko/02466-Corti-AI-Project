        Description:

            which outputs a pitch prediction and embedding of that pitch prediction. 
            The output is then added to the input passed to the embeddings, whose result is passed to
            the energy predictor, which outputs the same as the pitch predictor and lets the final resulting
            embedding be the energy embedding plus the input passed to the energy predictor.
